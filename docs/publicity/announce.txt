October 10, 2023 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.3 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.3

This release contains many important bug fixes, including for some
regressions in the previous 3.2.x releases, as well as build system
improvements and a few optimizations.

Without listing all of them, areas with the most improvements were:

- Internationalization support: fix setting Chinese and some other
  locales in wxOSX and setting Ukrainian locale in wxMSW and fix loading
  wxWidgets translations with wxTranslations::AddStdCatalog().

- Wayland support in wxGTK and, in particular, OpenGL support under
  Wayland: fix hiding wxGLCanvas and avoid catastrophically slowing
  down the entire program when it is hidden; fix crash when using IME;
  fixes to popup windows, menus and wxPreferencesEditor behaviour.

- Validators and input: don't allow pasting characters forbidden by
  wxTextValidator; do allow entering temporary invalid value when using
  numeric validators. Also fix entering dates in wxGenericDatePicker in
  nb_NO and other locales using months names in short date format.

- Key event generation: more fixes for non-US keyboard layout in wxGTK
  and also generate events for Command+Alt+Letter combination in wxOSX.

All in all, this release includes more than 200 fixes from almost 50
contributors, please see the full change log for more details:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.2.3/docs/changes.txt

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
